Smalltalk
An object-oriented, dynamically typed language that heavily influenced the development of modern object-oriented programming.
Smalltalk's influence on object-oriented programming and its ideas on messaging and dynamic typing heavily influenced languages like Ruby, Python, and Objective-C.

Self (1986):
Prototypes and Dynamic Dispatch: Self was one of the earliest languages to introduce prototype-based object-oriented programming, where objects inherit directly from other objects rather than classes. This approach has influenced languages like JavaScript, which is also prototype-based.
A prototype-based, dynamically-typed language designed for performance and experimentation with object-oriented programming concepts.

Lisp:
Lisp's influence on functional programming, metaprogramming, and homoiconicity has inspired modern languages like Clojure, JavaScript (through Lisp-influenced features like closures), and Julia.

C (1972):
The foundation of many modern languages, including C++, Objective-C, and C#, and its influence on system-level programming and performance has been significant.

Ada:
A high-level, statically typed language designed for safety-critical and embedded systems. It was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.
Ada's focus on safety and reliability has had an impact on modern languages with similar goals, such as Rust.

Prolog:
A declarative logic programming language designed for artificial intelligence and symbolic reasoning tasks.
Prolog's influence on logic programming and pattern matching has found its way into modern languages like Haskell and Scala.

Forth:
An interactive, stack-based language with a minimalistic design. It is often used in embedded systems and low-level programming.
Forth's stack-based approach influenced the design of PostScript and has had some influence on modern stack-based languages and virtual machines.

Tcl:
The combination of Tcl (Tool Command Language) and Tk (Toolkit) for creating graphical user interfaces and rapid prototyping.
Tcl's emphasis on simplicity and extensibility has influenced languages like Ruby and JavaScript in their design principles.

Erlang:
A functional programming language designed for concurrent and distributed systems, particularly for telecom applications.
Erlang's focus on concurrency and fault tolerance has inspired languages like Elixir and influenced the design of concurrent features in many modern languages.

Lua:
A lightweight, embeddable scripting language designed for extending applications and video game development.
Lua's lightweight and embeddable nature has been used as an embedded scripting language in many modern applications and video games.

APL:
A powerful array-oriented language known for its concise and expressive syntax, used in scientific and mathematical computing.
APL's array-oriented programming ideas have influenced languages like MATLAB and NumPy in the scientific and mathematical computing domain.

Pike:
A systems programming language created at the University of Cambridge, known for its simplicity and efficiency.
While not as widely used as some other languages, Pike's influence on modern languages may be less pronounced, but it has contributed to the development of systems programming languages.

Dylan:
An object-oriented, dynamic language with a Lisp-like syntax, intended for ease of use and productivity.
Although not as widely adopted as some other languages, Dylan's object-oriented features have had some influence on modern languages like Python.

Modula-2:
A statically typed language with modules and data abstraction, intended for systems programming and education.
Modula-2's influence on data abstraction and modules is evident in the design of languages like Modula-3 and Ada.

Oberon:
A procedural, imperative language developed as the successor to Pascal. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency.
Oberon's simplicity and focus on system programming have influenced languages like Go and Rust.

Icon:
A high-level language for string processing and symbolic computation. It was designed to support concurrent programming.
Icon's unique string manipulation capabilities have inspired the design of modern string processing libraries and features in various languages.

ATS:
A statically typed language with dependent types, designed for systems programming and formal verification.
ATS's ideas around dependent types and formal verification have influenced the development of modern languages, such as Rust and Idris.

Sather:
An object-oriented language with multiple inheritance, garbage collection, and support for generic programming.
Sather's support for multiple inheritance has had some impact on languages with similar features, such as C++ and Eiffel.

REBOL:
A versatile, lightweight language designed for network programming, distributed computing, and multimedia applications.
REBOL's versatility and focus on network programming have contributed to the design of some aspects of modern languages, particularly those related to networking.

Eiffel (1985):
Design by Contract (DbC): Eiffel introduced the concept of Design by Contract, where software components specify preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. This idea has been adopted by other languages and libraries, such as TypeScript, D, and Ada.
Object-Oriented Programming: Eiffel played a role in popularizing object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. These ideas have become fundamental in many modern languages like Java and C++.
An object-oriented language known for its emphasis on software design by contract, ensuring robustness and reliability.

Prograph (1992):
Dataflow-Based Programming: Prograph's dataflow-based approach to programming, where computations are triggered by data availability, has inspired various dataflow programming languages and environments.
A visual, dataflow-based language that allows programmers to create applications by connecting graphical components.
