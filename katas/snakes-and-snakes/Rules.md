# Snakes and Snakes
Alternative version of Snakes and Ladders, where all ladders are also snakes. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ixp5VozIs

Players take turns rolling a die. If they land on a position with a Snake, they get taken to an earlier position.

The following positions show where snakes are:
14 -> 4
17 -> 7
31 -> 9
38 -> 20
54 -> 34
59 -> 40
62 -> 19
64 -> 60
67 -> 51
81 -> 63
84 -> 28
87 -> 24
91 -> 71
93 -> 73
95 -> 75
99 -> 78

Rules:
- Player needs to roll 6 to get on board
- Player needs to land on 100 to win. If player would end up beyond 100, they move back again. For example, player is on position 98 and rolls a 5. They move 2 places up to 100, and 3 back to 97
- If player rolls a six, they get another turn
- Whoever lands on 100 first wins
