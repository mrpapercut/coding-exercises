# Code Katas
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer sharpen their skills through practice and repetition.

It often consists of a simple programming problem that is solved repeatedly, potentially in many different ways, each time refining the solution or finding new solutions.

## Katas
- Snakes and Snakes, a variant of Snakes and Ladders
- Sudoku Solver

## Ideas
Word Search:
Write a function that takes a 2D matrix of letters representing a word search puzzle and a target word. The function should find if the word exists in the puzzle (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Huffman Encoding:
Implement a function that takes a string as input and encodes it using Huffman coding, a method of lossless data compression.

Tower of Hanoi:
Write a function that takes the number of disks and three pegs as input and solves the Tower of Hanoi problem, moving the disks from the first peg to the last peg following the rules.

Graph Algorithms:
Implement common graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse a graph or find the shortest path between two nodes.

Merge Sort:
Write a function that takes an unsorted array of integers and applies the merge sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

Dijkstra's Shortest Path:
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

N-Queens Problem:
Write a function that takes an integer n and finds all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem, where n queens must be placed on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Knapsack Problem:
Implement the Knapsack problem algorithm to find the maximum value that can be obtained by filling a knapsack with a specific weight limit from a list of items with their weights and values.

AVL Tree:
Implement an AVL tree data structure with insertion, deletion, and balancing operations to maintain a balanced binary search tree.
